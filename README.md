# Random Tables

This is a simple app to create and roll different random tables. The only limit is that each entry should be a single line.
Every table is stored in local storage, so unless the user clears the storage of the app, the values should say. Also, the whole table database can be exported as a JSON file, just in case.

## Future features

- Importing the exported JSON to load tables
- Table search.
- Table organization (tags, or groups)
